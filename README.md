# Regression Analysis of NYC Airbnb Data
## Overview
For this project I have decided to use The NYC Airbnb dataset from Kaggle.com. Airbnb is a short version of it is original name AirBedandBreakfast.com and today it has become one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world.Airbnbâ€™s are becoming increasingly popular places for travelers of all ages to stay. Families, business professionals and solo travelers are all turning to Airbnb as an alternative to a traditional hotel room.These millions of listings generate lot of data that can be analyzed and used for business decisions, understanding of customers & providers behavior and performance on the platform. The flexibility of price, options of amenities as well as spread out location make them an appealing option for travelers.

## Goal
The idea of picking a property can seem daunting, however with careful analysis and data, determining neighborhood price can be narrowed down to make decision making easier. The aim of the project is to analyse the diffrent features and build ML model to predict price.  


## About the Dataset
The Datset is about Airbnb listings for different hosts in the boroughs of NYC. consist of 4895 observatuon and has been updated since 2008 until 2019 and offers detailed information regarding the price, number of reviews per month and its availability throughout the year.

## Approach

1. Implemented descriptive statistics and visualization techniques to understand the data.
2. Performed data cleansing to remove outliers and normalize skewed data.
3. Implemented Linear Regression and Tree regression using randomForest, Gradient Boosting to predict price.
4. Performed full grid search to optimize the model by tuning its hyperparameter. Achieved an accuracy of 60%.

## Model Comparison

Model	| Model Accuracy
------| --------------
Gradient Boost Tree(binning price) |	0.70
Random Forest |	0.54
Random Forest (Grid Search)	| 0.53
Gradient Boost Tree	| 0.52
Linear Regression(log transformed price)	| 0.48
Decision Tree |	0.40
Liner Regression | 0.09


## Conclusion
In this project, I tried to make predictions with different Regression models and compared their metric results. Ensemble learning performed better than the other models. Futher by tuning the model's hyperparameter, I was able to imporve the model accuracy.
